# PASSWORD ANALYSIST
Hey there! Welcome to our little project where we talk about password security. This project is all about taking your password, giving it a thorough check-up, and telling you whether it's ready to face the digital world or if it needs a bit of a boost.

## What's This All About?

We've put together a C++ program that acts like a fitness trainer for your passwords. It checks if your password is strong enough based on certain rules like:

- How long is it?
- Does it have a mix of upper and lower case letters?
- Got any numbers or special characters in there?

If your password doesn't quite cut it, no worries! We'll give you a chance to try again or we'll recommend up a secure password for you on the spot.

### Features

- Password Check: We rate your password out of 5. Think of it as a security strength score.
- Password Suggestions: If your password needs some work, we use a bit of random magic to create a new, secure one for you.
- User Friendly: Just type in your password, and we'll take care of the rest, giving you feedback and options.

## What You Need

To run this program, you just need:

- A C++ compiler (could be GCC, Clang, or even Microsoft Visual C++).
- An IDE or just a command line to do the compile and run dance.

## How to Get It Going

1. Compile It:
   - With GCC? Easy, just type: g++ -o password_analyzer password_analyzer.cpp
   - Or go with whatever C++ compiler you fancy.

2. Run It:
   bash    ./password_analyzer    

3. Use It:
   - Pop in your password when asked.
   - See how tough your password is.
   - Decide if you want to give it another go or let us whip up a new one for you.

## What's In Here?

- password_analyzer.cpp: That's where the magic happens, aka our source code.
